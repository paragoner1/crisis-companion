# Solana SOS (Crisis Companion) - Voice-Activated Emergency Response App

**Solana Mobile Hackathon Submission** | Built for Solana Mobile Seeker

## üö® The Problem 

Last summer, my 4-year-old son forgot his life jacket was off and almost drowned. I found him underwater and performed CPR without knowing what I was doing. That moment made me realize we need a tool that guides people through emergencies when they're in shock. That's why I built Solana SOS.

**The Reality:**
- **3.8M avoidable deaths annually** - 30-50% preventable with timely bystander action
- **236K drownings/year, 356K cardiac arrests** in US‚Äî50-90% preventable with bystander actions
- **"Prevent 50-90% of avoidable deaths via guided actions‚Äîdelays kill, we respond in under 100 milliseconds."**
- **Average EMS response time: 7-14 minutes** - survival drops 10% per minute without action
- **People panic and forget basic procedures** in emergency situations
- **Connectivity challenges** occur in remote areas, underground locations, during natural disasters, power outages, and network congestion when emergencies happen
- **Traditional apps require manual activation and internet** - not available when needed most

## üí° The Solution 

**Solana SOS** uses hybrid voice recognition (online primary, offline fallback) to detect emergency phrases like "Drowning help!" and immediately initiates a comprehensive emergency response.

### Current Emergency Types Supported (Initial Release):
- **Drowning**: "Drowning help!" ‚Üí CPR instructions (236,000 global deaths/year, 80% avoidable with immediate CPR)
- **Heart Attack**: "Heart attack!" ‚Üí CPR + AED guidance (356,000 US out-of-hospital deaths/year, 60-90% avoidable with CPR/AED within 3-5 min)
- **Choking**: "Choking help!" ‚Üí Heimlich maneuver (5,000 US deaths/year, 90%+ avoidable with Heimlich)
- **Bleeding**: "Bleeding emergency!" ‚Üí First aid steps (4.4M global trauma deaths/year, 50% avoidable with bleeding control)
- **Allergic Reaction**: "Allergic reaction!" ‚Üí EpiPen guidance (1,000 US deaths/year, 95% avoidable with EpiPen in 5 min)
- **Seizure**: "Seizure help!" ‚Üí Safety positioning (3,000 US deaths/year, 40% avoidable with proper positioning)
- **Heat Stroke**: "Heat stroke!" ‚Üí Cooling procedures (700 US deaths/year, 90% avoidable with immediate cooling)
- **Hypothermia**: "Hypothermia!" ‚Üí Warming techniques (1,300 US deaths/year, 90% avoidable with warming)
- **Burns**: "Burn emergency!" ‚Üí Cool water + treatment

### Key Features:
- **Voice-Activated**: Any emergency phrase triggers immediate response
- **Hybrid Recognition**: Online primary for accuracy, offline fallback for reliability
- **Auto Volume**: Sets phone to 100% during emergency
- **Step-by-Step**: Clear instructions for any emergency type
- **Automatic Actions**: Calls 911, shares location, records audio
- **Multi-Device**: BLE coordination between devices
- **Solana Blockchain**: Audio hash storage for verification
- **Universal Capability**: Perfect for any scenario - beaches, hiking, underground, during storms, power outages, or network congestion
- **Expandable Database**: Easy to add new emergency procedures

### Future Expansion:
- Easy to add new emergency types through database updates
- Community-contributed emergency procedures
- Industry-specific emergency protocols (construction, healthcare, etc.)
- Natural disaster response procedures
- Multi-language support for international markets

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Innovation

Built in **Rust** for high performance and memory safety:
- **Hybrid Voice Recognition**: Online primary (Google Cloud) + Vosk offline fallback
- **SQLite Database**: Local emergency instructions
- **Bluetooth Low Energy**: Multi-device coordination
- **Solana Blockchain**: Tamper-proof emergency data storage
- **Android JNI**: Mobile integration
