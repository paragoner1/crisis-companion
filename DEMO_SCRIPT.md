# Crisis Companion - Demo Script

## ðŸŽ¬ **Demo Video Script (2-3 minutes)**

### **Scene 1: Introduction (30 seconds)**
**[Camera shows you holding Solana Mobile device]**

"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to show you Crisis Companion - a voice-activated emergency response app for Solana Mobile.

Last summer, my 4-year-old son forgot he didn't have his lifejacket on and almost drowned at the lake. I found him underwater and performed CPR without knowing what I was doing. That moment made me realize we need a tool that guides people through emergencies when they're in shock. That's why I built Crisis Companion."

**[Show app running on device]**

### **Scene 2: Voice Trigger Demo (45 seconds)**
**[Camera focuses on the device screen]**

"Watch this. When someone says 'Drowning help!', the app immediately responds."

**[Say clearly and loudly]**
"Drowning help!"

**[Show on screen: App detects phrase, volume indicator goes to 100%, emergency instructions start playing]**

"Notice how the volume automatically went to 100% and emergency instructions started playing immediately. The app is now providing step-by-step CPR instructions."

### **Scene 3: Solana Integration (30 seconds)**
**[Show blockchain transaction on screen]**

"Here's where it gets interesting. The audio hash is being stored on Solana blockchain for security and audit purposes. This ensures the emergency data is tamper-proof and can be used for emergency response coordination."

**[Show transaction confirmation]**

### **Scene 4: Multi-Device Coordination (30 seconds)**
**[Show multiple devices or explain the concept]**

"If there are other Crisis Companion devices nearby, they automatically coordinate. One device dials 911, another records audio for emergency services, and another displays silent instructions for bystanders."

### **Scene 5: Market Opportunity (15 seconds)**
**[Show revenue numbers or business model]**

"With 15,000 users by 2027, this represents a $1.26 million revenue opportunity. We're ready to launch on Solana's dApp store and save lives."

**[End with app logo]**
