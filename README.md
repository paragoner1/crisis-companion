# 🚨 Solana SOS (Crisis Companion)

**The phone you can't live without.**

A voice-activated emergency response app for Solana Mobile Seeker that provides life-saving guidance in critical situations, with intelligent offline/online hybrid architecture.

## **Motivation**

Last summer, my world stopped when I found my 4-year-old son underwater. In sheer panic, I performed CPR blindly, praying it worked. That terrifying moment exposed a critical gap: In emergencies, shock paralyzes us. That's why I created Solana SOS—to guide anyone through life-saving actions, hands-free and instantly.

**The Reality:**
- **Over 300,000 people drown globally each year** - 80% preventable with immediate bystander action
- **356,000+ out-of-hospital cardiac arrests annually in the US** - survival plummets 10% every minute without help
- **Average EMS response time: 7-14 minutes** - too late for many emergencies
- **People panic and forget basic procedures** in emergency situations
- **Connectivity challenges** occur in remote areas, underground locations, during natural disasters, power outages, and network congestion when emergencies happen
- **Traditional apps require manual activation and internet** - not available when needed most

## 🎯 **The Problem**

Every year, **236,000 people drown** globally, with many deaths preventable through timely intervention. Emergency response delays cost precious seconds that can mean the difference between life and death.

## 💡 **The Solution**

Solana SOS combines **offline context-aware guidance** with **online AI enhancement** to provide the right help at the right time:

### **Offline Mode (Always Available)**
- **Context-aware stage detection** - understands where you are in the emergency
- **Fast, reliable guidance** - sub-second response for critical moments
- **No internet required** - works in remote areas, poor connectivity
- **Privacy-focused** - no data sent to external services

### **Online Mode (AI Enhanced)**
- **Intelligent questioning** - "Is the victim breathing? Are they conscious?"
- **Personalized guidance** - based on location, victim age, medical history
- **Complex scenario handling** - edge cases and unusual situations
- **Continuous learning** - improves from real emergency outcomes

### **Hybrid Architecture**
- **Smart routing** - offline for critical, online for complex scenarios
- **Graceful degradation** - online fails → offline continues seamlessly
- **Context preservation** - offline analysis informs online conversation
- **User choice** - prefer offline for privacy, online for complexity

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### **Context-Aware Emergency Guidance**
- **Smart phrase analysis** - "drowning help out of water" → post-extraction guidance
- **Stage detection** - InitialDetection, VictimExtracted, Unconscious, etc.
- **Time savings** - 45 seconds saved by skipping irrelevant instructions
- **Dynamic adaptation** - guidance changes based on current situation

### **Voice Recognition & Noise Filtering**
- **Offline Vosk recognition** - works without internet
- **RNNoise filtering** - removes background noise (waves, wind, crowds)
- **Adaptive training** - personalized accuracy for individual users
- **Confirmation system** - reduces false positives

### **Multi-Device Coordination**
- **Bluetooth Low Energy** - coordinates with nearby devices
- **Distributed response** - one device calls 911, another provides guidance
- **Offline synchronization** - works without internet connectivity

### **Solana Blockchain Integration**
- **Audio hash storage** - tamper-proof emergency data
- **BONK token rewards** - gamification for bystander actions
- **SKR token ecosystem** - Solana Mobile Seeker integration
- **Secure payments** - for emergency services and rewards

## 📱 **How It Works**

### **Offline Mode Example:**
```
User: "drowning help out of water"
App: "Check if victim is breathing and has a pulse"
App: "If not breathing, begin rescue breathing immediately"
App: "If no pulse, start chest compressions"
App: "Keep victim warm and dry"
App: "Monitor for secondary drowning symptoms"
[Immediate relevant guidance - 45 seconds saved]
```

### **Online Mode Example:**
```
User: "drowning help"
AI: "I understand you're dealing with a drowning emergency. Is the person still in the water?"
User: "No, I pulled them out"
AI: "Good. Is the person conscious and breathing?"
User: "They're conscious but coughing a lot"
AI: "That's common after a near-drowning. Let me guide you through monitoring for secondary drowning symptoms..."
[Personalized, conversational guidance]
```
