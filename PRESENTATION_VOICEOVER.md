# ðŸŽ¬ Solana SOS - Presentation Voiceover Script

**For Figma Slides Presentation**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Slide 1: Title Slide**

**Visual:** Solana SOS logo with tagline
**Duration:** 5 seconds

**Voiceover:**
*"Solana SOS - The phone you can't live without. Built by Paragoner for the Solana Mobile Hackathon 2025."*

## ðŸŽ¯ **Slide 2: The Hook**

**Visual:** Personal story image (child underwater)
**Duration:** 15 seconds

**Voiceover:**
*"A few years ago, my world stopped when I found my 4-year-old son underwater. In sheer panic, I performed CPR blindly, praying it worked. That terrifying moment exposed a critical gap: In emergencies, shock paralyzes us. That's why I created Solana SOSâ€”to guide anyone through life-saving actions, hands-free and instantly."*

## ðŸŽ¯ **Slide 3: The Problem**

**Visual:** Statistics and traditional app failure
**Duration:** 20 seconds

**Voiceover:**
*"Globally, approximately 236,000 people drown each year (WHO, 2021), and in the US alone, more than 356,000 suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrests annually. Most are preventable with bystander intervention, yet traditional apps falter: They demand manual input, stable internet, and calm thinkingâ€”impossible in crisis, especially in remote areas, storms, or network outages. EMS arrives in 7-14 minutes on average, but for cardiac arrest, survival plummets 10% every minute without help."*

## ðŸŽ¯ **Slide 4: The Solution**

**Duration:** 25 seconds

**Voiceover:**
*"Solana SOS combines offline context-aware guidance with online AI enhancement. It understands where you are in the emergency and provides the right help at the right time. When someone says 'drowning help out of water,' it doesn't waste time on 'stay calm' instructionsâ€”it jumps straight to checking if the victim is breathing. This saves 45 seconds in every emergency."*
