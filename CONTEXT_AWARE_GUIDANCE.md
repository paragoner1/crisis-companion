# 🎯 Context-Aware Emergency Guidance System

## **🚨 The Problem: Wasted Time in Emergencies**

### **Current Issue:**
When someone says **"drowning help"** but the person is already out of the water, the app wastes precious time with irrelevant instructions:

❌ **Wasted Instructions:**
- "Stay calm and assess the scene"
- "Look for lifeguard or trained help nearby"
- "If you must enter the water, use a flotation device"
- "Call 911 immediately"

### **The Solution: Context-Aware Guidance**
The app should **jump directly** to the appropriate guidance based on the current situation.

---

## **💡 How Context-Aware Guidance Works**

### **1. Stage Detection**
The system analyzes multiple context clues to determine the current emergency stage:

#### **Context Clues Analyzed:**
- **User Phrase**: "drowning help out of water"
- **Location**: Beach/Pool context
- **Actions Taken**: Victim already extracted
- **Victim Status**: Conscious, breathing, has pulse
- **Time Elapsed**: 2 minutes since emergency started

#### **Emergency Stages:**
- **InitialDetection**: Emergency just detected
- **VictimExtracted**: Victim out of danger, needs medical care
- **ConsciousButInjured**: Victim conscious but needs attention
- **Unconscious**: Victim unconscious, needs CPR
- **BreathingButUnresponsive**: Victim breathing but unresponsive
- **ServicesEnRoute**: Emergency services on the way
- **PostEmergency**: Post-emergency care

### **2. Context Analysis**
Based on the phrase **"drowning help out of water"**, the system detects:

✅ **Stage**: `VictimExtracted`
✅ **Skip Basic Steps**: `true`
✅ **Focus**: Medical care for post-extraction

### **3. Appropriate Guidance**
Instead of basic rescue instructions, the app provides:

✅ **Direct Medical Guidance:**
- "Check if victim is breathing and has a pulse"
- "If not breathing, begin rescue breathing immediately"
- "If no pulse, start chest compressions"
- "Keep victim warm and dry"
- "Monitor for secondary drowning symptoms"

## **🎯 Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: "Drowning help" - Person Already Out of Water**

**User Input:** "drowning help out of water"

**Context Analysis:**
- Phrase contains "out of water" → Post-extraction
- Location: Beach → Water emergency context
- Actions: Victim extracted → Skip rescue instructions
- Victim: Conscious, breathing → Focus on medical monitoring

**Result:**
```
Stage: VictimExtracted
Skip Basic Steps: true
Time Saved: 45 seconds
Guidance: Direct medical care instructions
```

### **Scenario 2: "Choking help" - Object Dislodged**

**User Input:** "choking help object out"

**Context Analysis:**
- Phrase contains "object out" → Post-extraction
- Actions: Object dislodged → Skip Heimlich instructions
- Victim: Conscious, breathing → Focus on airway monitoring

**Result:**
```
Stage: VictimExtracted
Skip Basic Steps: true
Time Saved: 45 seconds
Guidance: Airway assessment and monitoring
```

### **Scenario 3: "Heart attack" - Initial Response**

**User Input:** "heart attack help"

**Context Analysis:**
- Phrase indicates initial emergency → Initial detection
- No extraction needed → Provide basic instructions
- Victim: Conscious, critical → Immediate medical attention

**Result:**
```
Stage: InitialDetection
Skip Basic Steps: false
Time Saved: 0 seconds
Guidance: Call 911 and basic care instructions
```

## **🔧 Technical Implementation**

### **Stage Detection Algorithm:**
```rust
fn detect_stage(phrase: &str, context: &ContextClues) -> EmergencyStage {
    // 1. Analyze phrase patterns
    if phrase.contains("out of water") || phrase.contains("pulled out") {
        return EmergencyStage::VictimExtracted;
    }
    
    // 2. Analyze location context
    if location == Beach || location == Pool {
        return EmergencyStage::VictimExtracted;
    }
    
    // 3. Analyze actions taken
    if actions.contains(ExtractedVictim) {
        return EmergencyStage::VictimExtracted;
    }
    
    // 4. Analyze victim status
    if !victim.is_breathing || !victim.has_pulse {
        return EmergencyStage::Unconscious;
    }
    
    // 5. Default based on emergency type
    match emergency_type {
        Drowning => EmergencyStage::VictimExtracted,
        Choking => EmergencyStage::VictimExtracted,
        HeartAttack => EmergencyStage::InitialDetection,
        _ => EmergencyStage::InitialDetection,
    }
}
```

### **Guidance Generation:**
```rust
fn generate_guidance(emergency_type: EmergencyType, stage: EmergencyStage) -> EmergencyGuidance {
    match (emergency_type, stage) {
        (Drowning, VictimExtracted) => {
            EmergencyGuidance {
                instructions: vec![
                    "Check if victim is breathing and has a pulse",
                    "If not breathing, begin rescue breathing immediately",
                    "If no pulse, start chest compressions",
                    "Keep victim warm and dry",
                    "Monitor for secondary drowning symptoms",
                ],
                skip_basic_steps: true,
                focus_on_medical_care: true,
            }
        }
        // ... other combinations
    }
}
```
