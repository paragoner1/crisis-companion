# Crisis Companion - Solana Mobile Hackathon Presentation

## üö® **2-Minute Elevator Pitch**

### **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**
"Last summer, my family was at the lake when my 4-year-old son went missing. He forgot he didn't have his lifejacket on and fell in the water. I found him underwater, barely visible - just a hand sticking up. I jumped in, pulled him out, and performed CPR while not knowing what I was doing. That moment made me realize we need a tool that guides people through emergencies when they're in shock or not thinking clearly. That's why I built Crisis Companion."

### **Problem Statement (30 seconds)**
- Emergency response delays cost lives
- People panic and forget what to do

### **Solution (45 seconds)**
- **Voice AI**: Detects emergency phrases offline
- **Auto Response**: Sets volume to 100%, plays instructions
- **Multi-Device**: Coordinates via Bluetooth Low Energy
- **Solana Blockchain**: Stores audio hashes for security
- **Offline First**: Works without internet

### **Market & Revenue (15 seconds)**
- **Target**: 15,000 users by 2027
- **Revenue**: $1.26M/year (freemium + enterprise)
- **Market**: $10M acquisition potential

## üé¨ **Demo Script**

### **Setup (30 seconds)**
"Let me show you how Crisis Companion works. I have the app running on this Solana Mobile device. When someone says 'Drowning help!', the app immediately responds. This is the tool I wish I had when my 4-year-old son forgot his lifejacket and was drowning last summer."

### **Voice Trigger Demo (45 seconds)**
1. **Say**: "Drowning help!" (loud and clear)
2. **Show**: App detects phrase, volume goes to 100%
3. **Play**: Emergency instructions start automatically
4. **Explain**: "The app is now providing step-by-step CPR instructions"
5. **Highlight**: "Notice this works completely offline - no internet required"

### **Solana Integration (30 seconds)**
"Watch this - the audio hash is being stored on Solana blockchain for security and audit purposes. This ensures the emergency data is tamper-proof."

### **Multi-Device Demo (15 seconds)**
"If there are other Crisis Companion devices nearby, they automatically coordinate - one dials 911, another records audio, another displays silent instructions."

## ‚ùì **Anticipated Q&A**

### **Technical Questions**
**Q: How does voice recognition work offline?**
A: We use Vosk, an offline speech recognition library. The model is embedded in the app and processes audio locally without internet.

**Q: How do you prevent false positives?**
A: We use a confidence threshold of 80% and require specific emergency phrases. Multiple device coordination also helps validate real emergencies.

**Q: What's the battery impact?**
A: Voice recognition runs efficiently, and BLE coordination uses minimal power. We optimize for battery life while maintaining emergency readiness.

### **Business Questions**
**Q: How do you acquire users?**
A: Freemium model with free basic features, premium emergency features. Partner with emergency services, beach resorts, swimming pools.

**Q: What's your competitive advantage?**
A: Offline functionality, voice AI, multi-device coordination, and Solana blockchain integration. No other app combines all these features.

**Q: How do you monetize?**
A: $5-10/month premium subscriptions, $50K/year enterprise licenses for hospitals, resorts, and emergency services.

### **Market Questions**
**Q: Who is your target market?**
A: Primary: Beachgoers, swimmers, outdoor enthusiasts. Secondary: Elderly living alone, parents with young children.

**Q: How do you validate demand?**
A: Emergency response is a universal need. We're targeting the $236B emergency services market with a mobile-first solution.
