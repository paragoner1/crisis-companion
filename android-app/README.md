- **Solana Mobile Stack** - Full blockchain integration

## Architecture

```
Android App (Kotlin)
â”œâ”€â”€ MainActivity.kt          # Main UI and voice recognition
â”œâ”€â”€ EmergencyService.kt      # Background emergency handling
â”œâ”€â”€ VoiceRecognitionService.kt # Voice processing
â””â”€â”€ SolanaIntegration.kt    # Blockchain functionality

Rust Backend (JNI)
â”œâ”€â”€ Voice recognition algorithms
â”œâ”€â”€ Emergency response logic
â”œâ”€â”€ Database operations
â””â”€â”€ Blockchain transactions
```

## Setup

- **CALL_PHONE** - Emergency 911 calls
- **SEND_SMS** - Emergency contact alerts
- **INTERNET** - Solana blockchain connectivity

## Development

### Adding New Emergency Types
1. Add emergency type to `MainActivity.kt` voice recognition
2. Add emergency instructions to `getEmergencyInstructions()`
3. Update UI layout if needed

### Integrating with Rust Backend
1. Create JNI bindings in Rust
2. Call Rust functions from Kotlin
3. Handle data conversion between languages

### Solana Mobile Stack Integration
1. Implement Mobile Wallet Adapter
2. Add SKR token reward system
3. Store emergency records on blockchain

## Testing

### Voice Recognition Testing
```bash
# Test wake word detection
adb shell input text "Hey SOS"

# Test emergency phrase recognition
adb shell input text "drowning help"
```

### Emergency Flow Testing
1. Activate emergency mode
2. Verify 911 call simulation
3. Test location sharing
4. Validate emergency instructions

## Deployment

### dApp Store Preparation
1. **Code signing** - Generate release APK
2. **Privacy policy** - Emergency app requirements
3. **Terms of service** - Legal compliance
4. **Emergency disclaimers** - Medical/legal protection
