## üíô **Motivation**

A few years ago, my world stopped when I found my four-year-old son underwater. In sheer panic, I performed CPR blindly, praying it worked. That terrifying moment exposed a critical gap - in emergencies, shock paralyzes us. That's why I created **Solana SOS**, to guide anyone through life-saving actions, hands-free and instantly.
