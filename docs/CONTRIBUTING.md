   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-sos.git
   cd solana-sos
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

4. **Run Demos**
   ```bash

   ```

## üìù Code Style

### Rust Conventions

- Follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/style/naming/README.html)
- Use `cargo fmt` to format code
- Use `cargo clippy` to check for common issues
- Write comprehensive documentation for all public APIs

### Naming Conventions

- **Structs**: PascalCase (e.g., `VoiceTrigger`)
- **Functions**: snake_case (e.g., `detect_emergency_phrase`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`)
- **Files**: snake_case (e.g., `voice_interface.rs`)

### Documentation Standards

- Use `///` for public API documentation
- Include usage examples in documentation
- Document all error conditions
- Provide clear parameter and return value descriptions

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all public methods
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 90%+ code coverage

### Integration Tests

- Test complete emergency response workflows
- Verify hybrid offline/online functionality
- Test gamification system integration
- Validate safety feature operation

### Performance Tests

- Measure response times for critical operations
- Test memory usage under load
- Verify battery efficiency
- Benchmark voice recognition accuracy

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Data Protection

- Never commit sensitive data or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement proper access controls

### Code Security

- Validate all input parameters
- Use secure random number generation
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Reporting Security Issues

- **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
- Email security issues to: security@solanasos.com
- Include detailed reproduction steps
- Allow time for response before public disclosure
