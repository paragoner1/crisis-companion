# Solana SOS (Crisis Companion) - Voice-Activated Emergency Response App

**Solana Mobile Hackathon Submission** | Built for Solana Mobile Seeker

## üö® The Problem 

Last summer, my 4-year-old son forgot his lifejacket and almost drowned. I found him underwater and performed CPR without knowing what I was doing. That moment made me realize we need a tool that guides people through emergencies when they're in shock.

**The Reality:**
- **3.8M avoidable deaths annually** - 30-50% preventable with timely bystander action
- **Average EMS response time: 7-14 minutes** - survival drops 10% per minute without action
- **People panic and forget basic procedures** in emergency situations
- **Connectivity challenges** occur in remote areas, underground locations, during natural disasters, power outages, and network congestion when emergencies happen
- **Traditional apps require manual activation and internet** - not available when needed most

## üí° Our Solution 

**Solana SOS** uses offline voice recognition to detect emergency phrases like "Drowning help!" and immediately initiates a comprehensive emergency response.

### Current Emergency Types Supported (Initial Release):
- **Drowning**: "Drowning help!" ‚Üí CPR instructions (236,000 global deaths/year, 80% avoidable with immediate CPR)

- **Bleeding**: "Bleeding emergency!" ‚Üí First aid steps (4.4M global trauma deaths/year, 50% avoidable with bleeding control)
- **Allergic Reaction**: "Allergic reaction!" ‚Üí EpiPen guidance (1,000 US deaths/year, 95% avoidable with EpiPen in 5 min)
- **Seizure**: "Seizure help!" ‚Üí Safety positioning (3,000 US deaths/year, 40% avoidable with proper positioning)
- **Heat Stroke**: "Heat stroke!" ‚Üí Cooling procedures (700 US deaths/year, 90% avoidable with immediate cooling)
