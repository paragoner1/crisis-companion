**Narration:** "I'll demonstrate with the drowning example. Here's some demonstrated examples here. So watch as I say, hey SOS, drowning. Notice the instant response time under 100 milliseconds."

**Narration:** "The app immediately proves context-aware CPR guidance at max volume, automatically calls 911 with precise location sharing, and keeps the dispatcher on standby until I'm ready to connect."

**Narration:** "If I say, out of water, it intelligently skips rescue steps and goes straight for medical care instructions. The app records everything on Solana's blockchain for tamper-proof verification, and coordinates with nearby dispatchers."

**Narration:** "Solana's AI to prevent multiple guides. This is where technology meets the human need at the time of crisis. It blends AI speed with human instinct."
