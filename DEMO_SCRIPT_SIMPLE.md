# ðŸš¨ Solana SOS - Demo Script (One-Page Reference)

## ðŸŽ¬ **Scene Flow & Commands**

**Scene 1: Project Structure (0:00)**
*"Okay, so here we are in the terminal. Here's our product structure. Rust with cargo. Clean organization. Each module has a specific role."*
```bash
$ ls -lalsanon
$ tree src/
```
*"Voice detection. Audio management. Database. Blockchain. Everything working together."*

**Scene 2: Clean Build (0:26)**
*"Okay, here we've got a clean build. No warnings or errors. And here's our configuration."*
```bash
$ cargo build
$ cargo check
```
*"Hybrid voice recognition. Offline fallback. It works anywhere."*

**Scene 3: Voice Recognition Demo (0:50)**
*"Here we see the system respond. Voice trigger is detected. Emergency response is initiated."*
```bash
$ cargo run --bin voice_test
```
*"Blockchain verification. All happening in real time."*

**Scene 4: Context-Aware Guidance (1:09)**
*"And here we see the clean code. Context-aware guidance that understands emergency stages."*
```bash
$ cargo run --bin context_analysis_test
```
*"Async functions. Proper error handling. Each component works together."*

**Scene 5: Safety Features (1:22)**
*"The architecture supports multiple safety features. Silent SOS, crash detection, trusted network."*
```bash
$ cargo run --bin safety_features_test
```
*"All while keeping the core offline."*

**Scene 6: Gamification System (1:46)**
*"Token integration, BONK rewards, SKR ecosystem. The gamification system transforms users into heroes."*
```bash
$ cargo run --bin gamification_demo
```
*"Every component tested, every module is working."*

**Scene 7: Complete Emergency Response (2:10)**
*"Let's see a complete emergency response in action. From voice activation to 911 call."*
```bash
$ cargo run --bin complete_walkthrough
```
*"We're ready to save lives."*

**Scene 8: Emergency Types Coverage (2:35)**
*"Comprehensive coverage of 12 critical life-threatening emergencies."*
```bash
$ cargo run --bin simple_direct_actions_test
```
*"Each emergency type has specific guidance and direct actions."*

**Scene 9: Hybrid Architecture (3:00)**
*"Offline-first reliability with online enhancement when available."*
```bash
$ cargo run --bin hybrid_demo
```
*"Works anywhere, anytime. No internet required."*

**Scene 10: Solana Integration (3:25)**
*"Blockchain integration for immutable records and token rewards."*
```bash
$ cargo run --bin complete_walkthrough
```
*"All emergency data is immutable and verifiable."*

**Scene 11: Final Demo (3:50)**
*"Here's the complete system in action. Voice-activated emergency response that works offline."*
```bash
$ cargo run --bin complete_walkthrough
```
*"Solana SOS - Creating the phone you can't live without."*
