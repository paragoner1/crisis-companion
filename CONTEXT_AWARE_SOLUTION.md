# üéØ Context-Aware Emergency Guidance Solution

## **üö® Problem Solved: Eliminating Wasted Time in Emergencies**

### **The Original Problem:**
When someone says **"drowning help"** but the person is already out of the water, the app was wasting precious time with irrelevant instructions:

‚ùå **Before (Wasted 45 seconds):**
```
User: "drowning help out of water"
App: "Stay calm and assess the scene..."
App: "Look for lifeguard or trained help nearby..."
App: "If you must enter the water, use a flotation device..."
App: "Call 911 immediately..."
[45 seconds wasted on irrelevant instructions]
```

### **The Solution: Context-Aware Guidance**
The app now **jumps directly** to the appropriate guidance based on the current situation:

‚úÖ **After (Immediate Relevant Help):**
```
User: "drowning help out of water"
App: "Check if victim is breathing and has a pulse"
App: "If not breathing, begin rescue breathing immediately"
App: "If no pulse, start chest compressions"
App: "Keep victim warm and dry"
App: "Monitor for secondary drowning symptoms"
[Immediate relevant medical guidance]
```

## **üí° How It Works**

### **1. Smart Phrase Analysis**
The system analyzes what the user says to understand the current situation:

**Key Phrases Detected:**
- `"out of water"` ‚Üí Post-extraction stage
- `"pulled out"` ‚Üí Victim already rescued
- `"not breathing"` ‚Üí Unconscious victim
- `"conscious but"` ‚Üí Injured but conscious
- `"what now"` ‚Üí Needs next steps guidance

### **2. Context Clue Integration**
The system combines multiple sources of information:

**Location Context:**
- Beach/Pool ‚Üí Water emergency context
- Hospital ‚Üí Post-emergency care
- Remote ‚Üí Different guidance needed

**Actions Already Taken:**
- Victim extracted ‚Üí Skip rescue instructions
- 911 called ‚Üí Skip emergency calling
- CPR started ‚Üí Focus on continuing care

**Victim Status:**
- Conscious/breathing ‚Üí Focus on monitoring
- Unconscious ‚Üí Immediate CPR guidance
- Injured ‚Üí First aid instructions

### **3. Stage Detection**
The system determines the current emergency stage:

**Emergency Stages:**
- **InitialDetection**: Emergency just detected
- **VictimExtracted**: Victim out of danger, needs medical care
- **ConsciousButInjured**: Victim conscious but needs attention
- **Unconscious**: Victim unconscious, needs CPR
- **BreathingButUnresponsive**: Victim breathing but unresponsive
- **ServicesEnRoute**: Emergency services on the way
- **PostEmergency**: Post-emergency care

### **4. Dynamic Guidance Generation**
Based on the detected stage, the app provides:

**For Post-Extraction (VictimExtracted):**
- Skip basic rescue instructions
- Focus on medical assessment
- Provide immediate care guidance

**For Unconscious Victims:**
- Skip scene assessment
- Go straight to CPR instructions
- Focus on life-saving measures

**For Initial Detection:**
- Provide complete emergency response
- Include all basic safety steps
- Call 911 and assess scene

## **üîß Technical Implementation**

### **Core Components:**

**1. Stage Detection System (`src/context_analysis/stage_detection.rs`)**
```rust
pub struct StageDetector {
    phrase_analyzer: PhraseAnalyzer,
    context_analyzer: ContextAnalyzer,
    action_analyzer: ActionAnalyzer,
}
```

**2. Guidance Generation (`src/context_analysis/guidance_generation.rs`)**
```rust
pub struct GuidanceGenerator {
    stage_guidance: StageGuidance,
    emergency_adapters: Vec<EmergencyAdapter>,
}
```

**3. Context Analysis (`src/context_analysis/context_analysis.rs`)**
```rust
pub struct ContextAnalyzer {
    stage_detector: StageDetector,
    guidance_generator: GuidanceGenerator,
}
```

### **Key Algorithms:**

**Stage Detection:**
```rust
fn detect_stage(phrase: &str, context: &ContextClues) -> EmergencyStage {
    // 1. Analyze phrase patterns
    if phrase.contains("out of water") || phrase.contains("pulled out") {
        return EmergencyStage::VictimExtracted;
    }
    
    // 2. Analyze location context
    if location == Beach || location == Pool {
        return EmergencyStage::VictimExtracted;
    }
    
    // 3. Analyze actions taken
    if actions.contains(ExtractedVictim) {
        return EmergencyStage::VictimExtracted;
    }
    
    // 4. Default based on emergency type
    match emergency_type {
        Drowning => EmergencyStage::VictimExtracted,
        Choking => EmergencyStage::VictimExtracted,
        HeartAttack => EmergencyStage::InitialDetection,
        _ => EmergencyStage::InitialDetection,
    }
}
```

**Guidance Generation:**
```rust
fn generate_guidance(emergency_type: EmergencyType, stage: EmergencyStage) -> EmergencyGuidance {
    match (emergency_type, stage) {
        (Drowning, VictimExtracted) => {
            EmergencyGuidance {
                instructions: vec![
                    "Check if victim is breathing and has a pulse",
                    "If not breathing, begin rescue breathing immediately",
                    "If no pulse, start chest compressions",
                    "Keep victim warm and dry",
                    "Monitor for secondary drowning symptoms",
                ],
                skip_basic_steps: true,
                focus_on_medical_care: true,
            }
        }
        // ... other combinations
    }
}
```

## **üí≠ User Experience Impact**

### **Before Context-Aware System:**
```
User: "drowning help out of water"
App: "Stay calm and assess the scene..."
[User thinks: "I already did that!"]
App: "Look for lifeguard or trained help nearby..."
[User thinks: "There's no lifeguard here!"]
App: "If you must enter the water, use a flotation device..."
[User thinks: "They're already out of the water!"]
App: "Call 911 immediately..."
[User thinks: "I already called 911!"]
[45 seconds wasted, user frustrated, victim not getting proper care]
```

### **After Context-Aware System:**
```
User: "drowning help out of water"
App: "Check if victim is breathing and has a pulse"
[User thinks: "Yes, that's what I need to know!"]
App: "If not breathing, begin rescue breathing immediately"
[User thinks: "Perfect, I know what to do next!"]
