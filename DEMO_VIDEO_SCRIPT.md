# Solana SOS - Demo Video Script

## Demo Video Script (2-3 minutes)

### Scene 1: Introduction
[Camera shows you at your computer]

"Last summer, my 4-year-old son forgot his lifejacket and almost drowned. I found him underwater and performed CPR without knowing what I was doing. That moment made me realize we need a tool that guides people through emergencies when they're in shock. That's why I built Solana SOS."

### Scene 2: Problem Statement
[Show statistics or data visualization]

"Every year, 3.8 million people die from avoidable emergencies. Average EMS response time is 7-14 minutes, but survival drops 10% per minute without action. Traditional emergency apps require manual activation and internet connectivity, which may not be available in remote locations."

### Scene 3: Terminal Demo
[Camera focuses on the terminal screen]

"Watch this. I'm running the Solana SOS demo on my computer. When someone says 'Drowning help!', the app immediately responds."

[Run: cargo run --bin demo_test]

"Notice how the voice trigger is detected, emergency response starts, volume goes to 100%, and emergency instructions are retrieved from the database. This works completely offline - no internet required."

### Scene 4: Solana Integration
[Show blockchain output]

"Here's where it gets interesting. The audio hash is being stored on Solana blockchain for security and audit purposes. This ensures the emergency data is tamper-proof."

### Scene 5: Strategic Value
"This is why Solana SOS should be a default app on every Solana Mobile Seeker device. It gives Solana a unique competitive advantage - the only mobile platform that can save your life."

### Scene 6: Business Model
"With 80,000+ users by 2027 as the default app on Solana Mobile Seeker devices, this represents a $5.2 million revenue opportunity. We're ready to save lives and revolutionize emergency response."
