# Solana SOS (Crisis Companion) - Demo Script (Following Masterclass Template)

## ðŸŽ¬ **Demo Video Script (2-3 minutes)**

### **Scene 1: Hook & Introduction (15 seconds)**
**[Camera shows you holding Solana Mobile device]**

"Last summer, my 4-year-old son forgot his lifejacket and almost drowned. I found him underwater and performed CPR without knowing what I was doing. That moment made me realize we need a tool that guides people through emergencies when they're in shock. That's why I built Solana SOS."

**[Show app running on device]**

### **Scene 2: Problem Statement (15 seconds)**
**[Show statistics or data visualization]**

"Every year, 236,000 people die from drowning alone. When emergencies occur, people panic and forget basic procedures. Traditional emergency apps require manual activation and internet connectivity, which may not be available in remote locations."

### **Scene 3: Voice Trigger Demo (45 seconds)**
**[Camera focuses on the device screen]**

"Watch this. When someone says 'Drowning help!', the app immediately responds."

**[Say clearly and loudly]**
"Drowning help!"

**[Show on screen: App detects phrase, volume indicator goes to 100%, emergency instructions start playing]**

"Notice how the volume automatically went to 100% and emergency instructions started playing immediately. The app is now providing step-by-step CPR instructions. This works completely offline - no internet required."

### **Scene 4: Solana Integration (30 seconds)**
**[Show blockchain transaction on screen]**

"Here's where it gets interesting. The audio hash is being stored on Solana blockchain for security and audit purposes. This ensures the emergency data is tamper-proof and can be used for emergency response coordination."

**[Show transaction confirmation]**

### **Scene 5: Multi-Device Coordination (30 seconds)**
**[Show multiple devices or explain the concept]**

"If there are other Solana SOS devices nearby, they automatically coordinate. One device dials 911, another records audio for emergency services, and another displays silent instructions for bystanders."

### **Scene 6: Business Model (15 seconds)**
**[Show revenue numbers or business model]**

"With 80,000+ users by 2027 as the default app on Solana Mobile Seeker devices, this represents a $5.2 million revenue opportunity. We're ready to save lives and revolutionize emergency response."

## ðŸŽ¬ **Masterclass Demo Tips Applied**

### **Content Strategy**
- **Go through user experience** with voice-over
- **Comment with voice-over** during demo
- **Don't show it all** - leave them hanging a little
- **Don't rush it** - take your time

### **Technical Approach**
- **Prefer soundless demo** and do voice-over yourself
- **Embed demo video** in your deck or use QR code
- **Keep it concise** and easy to understand
- **Start with hook** - not by sharing everything

### **Audience Awareness**
- **Know your audience** - busy judges, many meetings
- **Empathy wins** - your personal story connects
- **Be memorable** - "tool I wish I had when my son was drowning"
- **Think elevator pitch** - you're here to tease

**Remember: The demo is more important than perfect code! Focus on showing the concept working and telling your compelling story.**
