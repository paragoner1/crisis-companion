# Solana SOS (Crisis Companion) - Solana Mobile Hackathon Presentation

## üö® **2-Minute Elevator Pitch **

### **Opening Hook - The 5% Success Factor**
"Last summer, my 4-year-old son forgot his life jacket was off and almost drowned. I found him underwater and performed CPR without knowing what I was doing. That moment made me realize we need a tool that guides people through emergencies when they're in shock. That's why I built Solana SOS."

### **Problem Statement (30 seconds) - Real Pain, Clear Urgency**
- **Critical Problem**: 3.8M avoidable deaths annually - 30-50% preventable with timely bystander action
- **Real Pain**: Average EMS response time is 7-14 minutes, but survival drops 10% per minute without action
- **Urgency**: Every second counts in life-or-death situations
- **Market Gap**: Traditional emergency apps require manual activation and internet connectivity

### **Solution (45 seconds) - Present Tense, Confident Statements**
- **Voice AI**: Solana SOS uses hybrid voice recognition (online primary, offline fallback) to detect emergency phrases
- **Auto Response**: The app automatically sets volume to 100% and plays step-by-step instructions
- **Multi-Device**: Coordinates with nearby devices via Bluetooth Low Energy
- **Solana Blockchain**: Stores audio hashes for security and audit purposes
- **Hybrid Approach**: Online primary for accuracy, offline fallback for reliability

### **Market & Revenue - Strategic Numbers**
- **Target**: 500K+ families by 2026 (default app on Solana Mobile Seeker)
- **Revenue**: $50M+ annually (device licensing + family subscriptions + institutional contracts)
- **Market**: 7.3 billion smartphone users worldwide by 2025, 2.3 billion households globally
